# Shrew

In an attempt to learn more about compilers and programming languages I am attempting to write a Scheme LISP using Go.

# Limitiations/Todos 

- [ ] Comments within function breaks functionaliy
- [ ] Start Variables with Numbers
- [ ] Variables can contain symbols
- [ ] Stop panicing
- [ ] Better REPL stuff (buffer history, nav with keys, etc)
